2. What is Narrative?
    - see below
3. How does Narrative and Ideology affect one another?
    - depending on what is shown in the narrative, it may reflect a certain kind of ideology
4. What are the approaches to Narrative?
    - marxist approaches
        - ideology works in the interests of the dominant class, whose ownership of the modes of production means they can control what values and beliefs are given expression
        - an ideology is "a representation of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence"
            - shifts the focus onto issues of representation and how cultural texts help us to make sense of the world and our place in it
        - ideology offers the individual a sense of coherence and belonging and relies on the individual's complicity in perpetuating his or her oppression by the system
5. What is Pierre Macherey’s (1978) idea of ideology?
    - the idea that ideology is full of gaps opened up a new kind of analysis in which what the text does not say or what it represses became just as important as identifying the ideological positions it seems to put forward
6. How did Barthes’ Mythologies affect the conception and evolution of ideology and narratology?
    - helped to shape and influence the emerging focus on ideology and the politics of representation
    - brought a new political dimension to narratology, moving away from more traditional notions of myth as reflecting shared needs and shared realities, to embrace "the contradictions of his time" and the role of myth in transitory and fragmented urban societies
    - helped to establish semiotics as a key conceptual and methodological framework for the analysis of contemporary media texts
7. What are the Rhetorical Approaches to Narrative and Ideology? What are their arguments?
    - the notion of narrative as "a purposive communicative act" where the intention is to influence the reader or audience
    - the telling of the story and the particular choices made in the narration have "designs on its audience's values" (full recognition of the fact that story tellers seek to shape and influence their audiences)
    - in highlighting the importance of ethical values for narrative, this view sees narrative as being less about a unidirectional flow of meanings from a source of authority to a passive receptacle than being about something that carries with it responsibilities on either side
    - providing us with the opportunity to exercise moral judgements and make ethical choices, not so much as to promote predetermined conclusions, but to encourage the development of interpretive and discursive skills
8. What is Dialogism? What is its effect on Narrative and Ideology?
    - in the dialogic text, there is a continuous interplay between voices, where the narrator's own discourse may appear as just one amongst many
9. What are the arguments of Postmodern and Postideological approaches to Narrative and Ideology?\
    - postmodernism
        - often characterized and caricatured as a rejection of the possibility of belief or faith in institutions and dominant discourses that purport to offer us absolute truths of any kind
        - we need to rewrite the Marxian formula "they do not know it, but they are doing it" to read instead "they know what they are doing, and they are doing it"
    - postideological
        - loss of faith or belief in institutions and systems of knowledge may mean we are now a "postideological" society
