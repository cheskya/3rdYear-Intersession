## Summary

If language gives meaning to experience, we have to think of it as the system in which our ideas become possible.

Language is a conceptual grid, a system of values, through which we experience reality.

If figures of speech rely on an accepted system of thought, they also reveal to the critical reader that it is a system, that it is not a simple reflection of reality.

## Answers

How does figurative language, including figures and language, advance Ideologies/Worldviews? Identify McLaughlin’s main points regarding this.

- The figurative history of a word is a part of its meaning and is therefore appropriate to a poetic interpretation whether or not the poet was aware of or intended it.
    - These figures are the language's own contribution to the meaning of the poem.
    - Consequence: The opposition between "proper" and "figurative" comes into question. Figures seem to be infiltrating the defenses of rightful meaning!
    - Figures ask the reader to think in terms of a complex system of categories and analogies in order to make sense of them
    - Even when there is no strongly figurative etymology, meaning is figurative in the sense that it relies on categories and associations.
    - Language is this not a simple process of naming preexisting objects and states but a system through which we give meaning to the world.
- If language gives meaning to experience, we have to think of it as the system in which our ideas become possible.
    - Language is a conceptual grid, a system of values, through which we experience reality.
- Figures play a powerful role even in areas of thought which are suspicious of figures, such as philosophy and science.
    - (Check the reading for examples, p. 8 of 11, or p. 87 of actual book)
- If all levels of thought are figurative, the power in the act of perception and understanding seem to lie in language.
- If figures of speech rely on an accepted system thought, they also reveal to the critical reader that it is a system, and that it is not a simple reflection of reality.
- Figures and the systems they imply should not, however, be condemned as brainwashing techniques by which those in power control our thoughts and feelings. They are inevitable in any use of language and are not the exclusive property of those in power.

Reflect on your own figurative language and the ideologies they carry.
