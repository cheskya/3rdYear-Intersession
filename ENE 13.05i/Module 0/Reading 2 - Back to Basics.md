# Back to Basics

"Folk Tales and Fairy Tales"

Module 1 will be focusing on **Narrative Structures**. The following shall be your guide in reading the chapter:

1. What is the main argument of Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale?
	- the template for narrative can be broken down into 31 functions
	- these are the components that make up the main action of the tale
	- these functions help us identify recurring types of events in a narrative and how they contribute to driving the narrative along and to building up momentum and suspense (a quest!)
	- focus is not on isolated actions or events, but on the consequences actions have as part of a sequence
2. What are its 31 functions? (PCTSRR, pacute sawrryyy)
	- there's no way i'm writing all dat (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition)
3. What are Propp's 4 observations of the recurring functions? (CLIO)
	- *functions of characters* serve as stable, constant elements in a table, independent of how and by whom they are fulfilled (they constitute the fundamental components of a tale)
	- number of functions known to fairy tale is limited
	- sequence of functions is always identical
	- all fairy tales are of one type in regard to their structure
4. What are the 7 spheres of action of characters? (HHDDFVP)
	- hero
	- villain
	- donor (or provider)
	- helper
	- dispatcher
	- false hero
	- princess and her father (sought-for-person)

Propp refers to characters as dramatis personae or "spheres of action" because he is concerned not so much with personality or moral worth but with the role the character plays in the action.

## Applications of Propp's Theory

Propp’s morphology therefore and categorised a narrative structure that is identifiable not just in folk tales but in contemporary narratives of many kinds, the most obvious being narratives for children and action adventure movies where the hero saves the day.

Some applications of Propp’s morphology rely on interpreting the functions nonliterally.

## Critiques and Reappraisals of Propp

Propp remains a divisive figure, his work undermined for many by a flawed methodology and a tendency to overstatement.
