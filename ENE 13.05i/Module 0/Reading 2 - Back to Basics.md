"Folk Tales and Fairy Tales"

Module 1 will be focusing on **Narrative Structures**. The following shall be your guide in reading the chapter:

1. What is the main argument of Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale?
	- the template for narrative can be broken down into 31 functions
	- these are the components that make up the main action of the tale
	- these functions help us identify recurring types of events in a narrative and how they contribute to driving the narrative along and to building up momentum and suspense (a quest!)
	- focus is not on isolated actions or events, but on the consequences actions have as part of a sequence
2. What are its 31 functions?
	- there's no way i'm writing all dat (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition)
3. What are Propp's 4 observations of the recurring functions?
	- *functions of characters* serve as stable, constant elements in a table, independent of how and by whom they are fulfilled (they constitute the fundamental components of a tale)
	- number of functions known to fairy tale is limited
	- sequence of functions is always identical
	- all fairy tales are of one type in regard to their structure
4. What are the 7 spheres of action of characters?
	- hero
	- villain
	- donor (or provider)
	- helper
	- dispatcher
	- false hero
	- princess and her father (sought-for-person)
