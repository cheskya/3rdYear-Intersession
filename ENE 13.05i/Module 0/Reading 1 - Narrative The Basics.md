# Narrative: The Basics

The following shall be your guide in reading the book:

1. Define the key terms: narrative, story, plot, character, storyworld, narration, narratology.
	- Narrative
		- (own def) an image that we create or find from a story that educates us about the world around us
	- Story
		- chronological sequence of events that underlies the narrative
		- something that has been artificially abstracted from the finish tale
		- Story: "The king died and then the queen died."
	- Plot
		- refers to the shaping of the story into a logical structure which shows the casual connection between those events
		- Plot: "The king died and then the queen died of grief."
	- Character
		- a participant in the world depicted by the narrative
		-  the focus is often on what they do rather than who they are, in terms of personality or psychology
		- embedded narratives
	- Narration
		- the telling of the story
	- Storyworld
		- Can be used interchangeably with fictional world, discourse world, and diegesis to refer to the real or imaginary environments in which the action of the narrative takes place
		- worldbuilding!!
	- Narratology
		- usually reserved for theories that attempt to provide a systematic model for narrative which can be universally applied
2. Differentiate story, narrative and plot.
	- story is just the chronological order of events
	- plot is the story but you connect the events together and therefore give them meaning
	- narrative is what you get out of the story and plot

## What is Narrative?

When the theorist Roland Barthes asserted that narrative "‘s simply there, like life itself"...

Narratives don’t just entertain us, therefore, but educate, inform and persuade us, affecting our actions and interactions with one another in all manner of ways.

Barthes was one of a group of writers and thinkers in the 1960s and 1970s who transformed the study of narrative and established it as a distinct discipline. Their groundbreaking work initiated what has since become known as the ‘narrative turn’, not just influencing the humanities, but also the social sciences and, more recently, the sciences, as it has been argued that the human impulse to generate narratives may offer us insights into the very workings of our minds.

### Narrativity

(What do people think constitutes the essential properties of a narrative, or its narrativity?)

Most theorists base their definitions on events, sequence and causality...

Marie-Laure Ryan
- traditionalist view
- narrative is conceived of as an ‘invariant core of meaning’ distinguishing it from all other types of discourse, and allowing it to be transported or carried across time, culture and medium.
- conceives of narrative as a medium-free "cognitive construct" producing "time image of a concrete world that evolves in time".
- narrative relies on the reader's interest for what comes next (emotional attachment to the characters as something stable and definable, which remains constant across all the different concretisations that a story may take)
- does allow for different modes of narrativity, including a spectrum from the simple to the complex, in line with other narratologists who have argued for narrativity as a matter of degree
- perceive narrativity to be a quality inherent in a text

Monika Fludernik
- argues that we as readers look for ways to understand events as part of a narrative
- narrativisation is more a reading strategy than a matter of the formal properties of a text.
- Fludernik's definition of narrativity is centred on the notion of experientiality, relying on the presence of some kind of conscious and embodied self with whom we share the emotions and sensations that the narrative evokes.
- focuses more on what we as readers to to activate texts as narative

Narrativity may also be differently understood when it comes to visual narratives or music, where the terms visuality, pictoriality and musicality may be used alongside or in opposition to narrativity.

Narrativity or narrativehood may also be understood as an aspect or even a condition of our humanity.

Constructivist view of narrative
- stories do not just happen, they are made
- the kinds of stories we have available to us are shaped for us by the particular culture or society we live in
- narrative imitates life, but life also imitates narrative, meaning that our sense of the world we live in and our idea of ourselves is shaped by this narrativising process

### Narrative and the Mind

More recently, it has been argued that narrative forms, especially
the novel, build on but in turn help shape and even train our ability
to read the minds of others, to empathise with them and imagine
ourselves in their shoes.

Cognitive narratology
- draws on research from the cognitive sciences and psychology to try to understand how this works and argues that novels and other narrative forms can offer insights into complex psychological states and even pathologies.

### The End of Narrative and Non-Narratives

#### "Narrative is crucial to a good life." Really?

Strawson takes issue with not just the notion that narrative is an ines-
capable part of our lives, but that ‘Narrativity is crucial to a good
life’.

He contends that the preoccupation with narrativity is potentially dangerous or destructive for those who feel that their lives do not fit the narrative model. 

Others also take issue with this, and argue for the importance of other ways of showing or recording experience or displaying subjectvity (e.g. ritual, song, poetry, dance)

#### Unnarratable, Disnarrated

Meanwhile, in narratology the term ‘unnarratable’ (Prince 1987) is
used for events that are so incidental or trivial that they do not need
to be narrated or events which cannot or should not be narrated
because they are taboo (e.g. a character’s bathroom visits). Prince
(1988) also coined the term the ‘disnarrated’ to refer to what does
not take place, for example, a character’s hopes or dreams that never
come to fruition or a road not taken by a character.

### Narrative Across Media and Culture

New media! Video games, videos, social media stories!

New technologies may provide new affordances for storytelling, allowing readers and users to interact with and even control the narrative or providing us with new ways of understanding narrative, as database or algorithm (Manovich 2001). However, as we try to come to terms with these changes we need to guard against the ‘strategic errors’ (Ryan 2010: 25) of trying to fit all media into models derived from language-based narratives, ignoring the medium-specific features of film, videogames and so on.
