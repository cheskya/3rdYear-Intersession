# Narrative Voice and Point of View

Welcome to Module 3!

In this module we will dive into **Context**. With this, you have to read Chapter 3 of our textbook "Narrative Voice and Point View" to figure out the role of a) Narrative Voice and b) Point of View in defining the context of story and narrative.

Please be guided of the following questions in your reading:

1. Define the following terms: creator/author, audience, narrator, focalization, framing, embedding, paratext and intertextuality.
2. What are the types of narration?
3. How do point of view and ideology work together?
4. How can Genette's theories be varied and revised in narratives?
5. How are speech and thought represented in narratives?

Note:

1. A quiz will be given on Monday, June 24, 2024. 
2. We will also have recitations during the discussion.

Do your best!

## Content

### layering of the narrative

inner layers  represent the various ways in which other voices and perspectives may be embedded within the outer layers, offering the reader or audience multiple points of view which may conflict and contradict one another

first level: narration

- non-narration
    - effect is as of a viewer overhearing events rather than being addressed by an identifiable individual
    - or maybe minimal narration
- cinematic narrator
    - organizing principle or agency whose range and influence can encompass a variety of semiotic channels
- cybernetic narration
    - the orchestration of semiotic channels in time, responsible for establishing ‘meaningful connections between the technological and the literary’ in digital fiction
- unnatural narration
    - to account for the phenomenon, particularly in postmodern and experimental narratives, whereby the basic premise or scenario of the narration defies logic or the laws of physics in some way
    - e.g. narrated by animals or someone who has died or who hasn't been born yet

### the narrator

When narratives are adapted from one medium to another, particularly from page to screen, the loss of a text’s distinctive narrative voice may be felt keenly.

### narrative framing and embedding

framing
- the separation between the fictional and ‘real’ world
-  also used to describe how narratives may be embedded in a text
- who does the framing?
    - narrator
    - paratextual material (e.g. preface, author biography, trailer, posters, prepublicity)
- in some complex stories where there is multiple embedding, the framing can get messy
    - For this reason, Marie-Laure Ryan (1990) suggests that that we should replace the metaphor of the frame for that of the stack, derived from the language of computer programming. In this conceptualization, like plates stacked on top of each other, the movement of one element impacts on the others in a way that is dynamic rather than static or fixed from the outset.

### focalization

focalization
- distinguishing between mood and voice, between who sees and who speaks
- a corrective to what he saw as the confusion between point of view and narration which had characterized theories of narrative to date (referring to Genette)
- was intended to avoid the visual connotations of point of view, and has become the preferred term in narrative studies
- owes much to modernist literature and its radical break from some of the traditions of the realist novel
- As Murphet (2005: 89) puts it, ‘Focalization becomes an issue when we shift into the diegetic world and begin to have our perceptions and thoughts shaped by the characters who attract and direct narrative discourse’

### point of view and ideology

- Certainly, representing the perspective of an individual can be highly persuasive, drawing on the emotions and reactions of that individual as he or she is caught up in events.
- In news stories, the perspective from which events are relayed to us may be significant in terms of how we apportion blame or responsibility.

### focalization in visual narratives

The ethical issues arising from the positioning of the viewer in relation to what he or she sees, and the extent to which viewers identify with what they are being shown, have been explored more fully in relation to cinematic narratives and the notion of scopophilia, spectatorship and voyeurism.

While the point-of-view shot can bring the viewer uncomfortably close to the perspective of one of the characters on screen, other techniques exist which perhaps place us more alongside rather than inside their perceptual fields.

associative focalization (Julian Murphet)
- associate the filmed perceptions with the face we see in successive shots... to fuse and form a single, complex image in the mind
- the viewer associates the emotions and reactions conveyed by a close-up on the face of one of the characters with objects in the shot, seeing those objects as though through the eyes of that face

direct focalization (?)

### focalization and immersion

(check later)

### variations and revisions of Genette's Theories

what's up with focalization
- may be both variable, shifting between characters, and multiple, where the ‘same’ events may be presented from the point of view of different characters
- Any single formula of focalization does not, therefore, always bear on an entire work, but rather on a definite narrative section, which can be very short

what people have done
-  focalization can shift between characters mid paragraph and even mid sentence, but it is the narrator who makes possible this dipping in and out of perspectives and who speaks and gives voice to the thoughts, feelings and beliefs of others
-  perspective in a sense close to that of a visual artist or even a filmmaker, representing the events of the story, the conversations taking place between visitors to the gardens, as though they are witnessed or overheard from within the flowerbeds as they pass by

focalization in three facets (Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan)
- perceptual
    - what the focalizer sees, hears, etc.
- psychological
    - what they are thinking or feeling
- ideological
    - what they believe based on a particular worldview or value system

This allows for the possibility in narrative that we may share the perceptual field of one character (e.g. a child) while the moral evaluation of what we are seeing may be left to another character (e.g. a figure of authority or adult perhaps).

Following Mieke Bal, Rimmon-Kenan also departs from Genette’s account of focalization to allow for the fact that a narrator may also be a focalizer and that focalization may be embedded in much the same way as narration.

### representing speech and thought

mimesis
- storyteller steps back from the scene as though directly showing or reporting what was said
- at the other extreme, the storyteller offers only their indirect account of what was said

representation of speech and thought is intertwined with the degree or mediation or intervention imposed by the storyteller

free indirect discourse
- the combination of two voices, although it may actually combine many more than two voices, where a narrator's representation of events is coloured by the perspective of one or more characters

## Guide Questions

Define the following terms: creator/author, audience, narrator, focalization, framing, embedding, paratext and intertextuality.

- creator/author
- narrator
    - person who narrates or controls the narration of something
    - types of narrators
        - In a live storytelling situation, the person telling the story is physically present, and his or her personal charisma, demeanour and skills may produce an immediate, affective response from the audience.
        - contemporary media such as television offer audiences a kind of ‘secondary orality’, compensating for the lack of physical proximity and the sharing of a social space through devices such as direct address or the close up
    - narrative voices are important to the narrative (and affects the audience's perspective)
    - When we talk of a narrative voice, what we are pointing to is the expressive and interpersonal potential of this technique, as over the course of reading or watching a narrative we tune in to the distinctive rhythms, inflections and idioms of the narration.
    - may be unreliable, and their lack of knowledge or willful deceit may be important in helping to sustain suspense
- framing
    -  the separation between the fictional and ‘real’ world
- focalization
    - distinguishing between mood and voice, between who sees and who speak

What are the types of narration?

-  relationship of the narrator to the fictional world or diegesis (Genette)
    - heterodiegetic narrator
        - narrator is positioned outside of the events of the narrative
    - homodiegetic
        - narrator takes part in the events of the narrative
- types of narration based on the narrator's position relative to the story (Genette)
    - subsequent (classic past tense narration)
    - prior (predicting what will happen either in future or present tense; e.g. in a prophetic or futuristic narrative)
    - simultaneous (as in a running commentary)
    - interpolated/intermittent (between the moments of the action)
- narration in terms of different levels, using spatial imagery to refer to some acts of narration as being higher than others (Genette)
    - extradiegetic narration
        - told from outside/above the action, as in omniscient narration
    - intradiegetic narration
        - told from within the storyworld
    - metadiegetic
        - where the telling of the story is taken on by one or more of the characters
    - metalepsis (NOT A PHASE, just a term)
        - a transgression of levels where, for example, an extradiegetic narrator intrudes into the diegesis or ‘breaks the frame’ of the narrative, disrupting the boundaries between the world of the story and the narration in ways which are often, but not always, comic


How do point of view and ideology work together?

- Certainly, representing the perspective of an individual can be highly persuasive, drawing on the emotions and reactions of that individual as he or she is caught up in events.
- In news stories, the perspective from which events are relayed to us may be significant in terms of how we apportion blame or responsibility.

How can Genette's theories be varied and revised in narratives?



How are speech and thought represented in narratives?

- devolves control and power in a narrative
- gives up the telling of the story to a whole multitude of different possibilities, opening it up to potentially conflicting interpretations
