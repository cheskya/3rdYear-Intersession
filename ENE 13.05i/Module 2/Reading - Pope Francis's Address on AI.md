## Content

- introduction to AI
    - extremely powerful tool
    - employed in many kinds of human activity
    - its use will increasingly influence the way we live, our social relationships, and even the way we conceive of our identity as human beings
- the question about AI
    - on one hand it generates excitement (the possibilities!)
    - on the other it gives rise to fear (the dangers and consequences)
    - the advent of AI represents a true cognitive-industrial revolution, which will contribute to the creation of a new social system characterized by complex epochal transformations
        - enable a democratization of access to knowledge
        - enable an exponential advancement of scientific research
        - the possibility of giving demanding and arduous work to machines
        - could bring with it a greater injustice between advanced and developing nations or between dominant and oppressed social classes
        - raises the dangerous possibility that a "throwaway culture" be preferred to a "culture of encounter"
- AI as a tool
    - techno-human condition
        - human beings have always maintained a relationship with the environment mediated by the tools they gradually produced
    - technology as a sign of our orientation towards the future
    - use of our tools is not always directed solely to the good
        - this is why ethics is important
- AI as a *complex* tool
    - AI can autonomously adapt to the task assigned to it and, if designed this way, can make choices independent of the person in order to achieve the intended goal
    - BUT it should be remembered that a machine can produce algorithmic choices. human beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.
    - we would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people's ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines
- controlling AI as a tool
    - no machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being (ban the use of devices like the so-called "lethal autonomous weapons")
    - the good use of AI will not be fully under the control of either the users or the programmers who defined their original purposes at the time they were designed
- basic mechanism of AI
    - essentially AI is a tool designed to solve specific problems. yet for those who use it, there is often a temptation to draw general, or even anthropological, deductions from the specific solutions in offers
    - the quality of the answers that AI programs provide ultimately depends on the data they use and how they are structured
    - it not only runs the risk of legitimizing fake news and strengthening a dominant culture's advantage, but also undermines the educational process itself (students use generative AI a lot)
        - for generative AI, rather than being "generative", it is instead "reinforcing" in the sense that it rearranges existing content, helping to consolidate it, often without checking whether it contains errors or preconceptions
- a shared ethical proposal
    - the season of technological innovation we are currently living in is accompanied by a particular and unprecedented social situation in which it is increasingly difficult to find agreement on the major issues concerning social life
    - it is the ethos that is most at risk in the implementation and development of these systems
    - technology, in its impact on human society, always represents a form of order in social relations and an arrangement of power, thus enabling certain people to perform specific actions while preventing others from performing different ones
        - this constitutive power dimension of technology always includes the worldview of those who invented and developed it
    - ethical inspiration
        - must always be aimed at the good of every human being
    - ethical decision
        - one that takes into account not only an action's outcomes but also the values at stake and the duties that derive from those values
    - ethical analysis
        - we can make use of other types of tools
        - if we struggle to define a single set of global values, we can find shared principles with which to address and resolve dilemmas or conflicts regarding how to live
- the politics needed
    - AI might limit our worldview, thereby excluding the contribution of other forms of truth and imposing uniform antropological, socio-economic and cultural models
    - politics is necessary!!
    - healthy politics
        - much needs to change, through fundamental reform and major renewal
        - involves the most diverse sectors and skills
        - "An economy that is an integral part of a political, social, cultural and popular programme directed to the common good could pave the way for ‘different possibilities which do not involve stifling human creativity and its ideals of progress, but rather directing that energy along new channels’"

short summary of the reading:
- AI has nice uses and helps make work easier BUT
- also perpetuates a single type of information
- might limit our worldview
- and allowing AI to make our decisions for us is not the way to go... (the choices made by AI are often biased too, according to what info they take in and what they are designed to do)
- we need to think about how AI and other tools can be made with everyone in mind, and also think about their consequences
- we need to have politics that involves everyone and is directed to the common good

## Analysis

not sure if i'm analyzing it correctly honestly...

SDRAR

- state of equilibrium
    - AI for good
- disruption of equilibrium
    - AI endangering many people
    - AI can perpetuate info (and limit worldview)
- recognition
    - AI should be controlled, no machine should decide for us humans, especially on important matters such as life (may take away our autonomy)
    - AI as a tool
    - more of the discussion regarding that
- attempt
    - shared ethical proposal
- reinstatement
    - healthy politics
