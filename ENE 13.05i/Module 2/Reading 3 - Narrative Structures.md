# Narrative Structures

In this module we will dive into Story, Narrative and Discourse. With this, you have to read Chapter 2 of our textbook "Narrative: The Basics" (pp. 28-40) to trace the development of Narrative Structures from Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale until the narrative theories mentioned in the chapter.

 Please be guided of the following questions in your reading:

1. Define Discourse, Representation, Order, Frequency, Style, and Intertextuality.
2. Differentiate Claude Levi-Strauss' narrative theory from Vladimir Propp's.
3. What are the five (5) basic stages of narrative according to Tzvetan Todorov?
4. What is binary opposition according to Levi-Strauss? 
5. What is the argument of David Lodge regarding story and discourse?
6. What are Gerard Genette's three (3) aspects of narrative?
7. What is Poststructuralism and what is its impact on narrative theory?
8. How significant are the mentioned concepts from numbers 1-7 in the understanding and theorization of story, narrative and discourse?

## Guide Questions

1. Define Discourse, Representation, Order, Frequency, Style, and Intertextuality.
    - Discourse
        - (according to Chatman) story refers to the content plane, discourse refers to the plane of the narrative's expression
        - story as itself, discourse as text
        - by separating story from discourse, we can begin to explore the way in which the "same" story can be told differently, depending on aspects such as where the teller begins the tale, how much time they spend on the story events and so on
    - Representation
        - not sure about this
        - Levi-Strauss's diagrammatic representation of his analysis of the Oedipus myth
            - distinguishes between the telling of the myth and understanding the myth
        - binary oppositions
            - sometimes the sides in a binary opposition represent something specific to their culture
            - e.g. some zombie narratives have the zombies come to represent all outsiders, particularly those excluded because of their sexuality or ethnicity
    - Order
        - how events are ordered in a narrative (may be significant in terms of the importance we assign to them and how we connect those events together, so that if events appear out of chronological sequence we tend to search for reasons why)
        - how this may depart from the chronological order of the story
        - flashback - look behind to events in the past
        - flashforward - look ahead to events in the future
    - Duration
        - duration of the events
        - there may be a close correspondence between the time events take in reality and the time devoted to narrating them
    - Frequency
        - how often the narrative tells us about an event that has taken place
        - "singulative" instance is most common
        - if we are told "repetitively" about the same event, this may suggest that it is particularly noteworthy
    - Style
        - not sure about this, so i'll just paste some related text
        - "In particular, disputes have arisen over the extent to which ‘story’ is separate from discourse, an abstraction or something that is purely ‘synthetic’ (Phelan 1989) and distinct from aspects of the writer’s style or the medium in question."

    - Intertextuality
        - meaning relations between text
        - from the web - the relationship between texts, especially literary ones
2. Differentiate Claude Levi-Strauss' narrative theory from Vladimir Propp's.
    - Propp
        - focused on a sequential (syntagmatic) analysis of narrative
        - syntagmatic - relating to the way different words or language elements can be combined to make language structures
    - Levi-Strauss
        - more concerned with understanding what myths and tales tell us about *human cultures* and how the myths generated and shared by those cultures address the anxieties and contradictions that characterize and shape their worldview
        - opened up the study of narrative in terms of understanding how stories are related to ideology, to systems to belief which define and shape cultures and the people who live in them
        - analyzed how signs are chosen on the basis of association (a paradigmatic) analysis
        - paradigmatic - relating to the way different words or language items can be chosen to play a particular part in a language structure
        - the focus is not only on how events drive the narrative forward, but on exploring the connections created by thematic associations or the "bundles" of relations that exist between elements of the narrative (analysis on the vertical and horizontal plane)
3. What are the five (5) basic stages of narrative according to Tzvetan Todorov? (SDRAR)
    - A state of equilibrium at the outset
    - A disruption of the equilibrium by some action
    - A recognition that there has been a disruption
    - An attempt to repair the disruption
    - A reinstatement of the initial equilibrium
4. What is binary opposition according to Levi-Strauss? 
    - human being divide the world around them into sets of binary oppositions
    - these are mutually exclusive categories that set light against dark, up against down, etc.
    - helps explain why many narratives turn on a kind of central conflict between opposing forces
    - Levi-Strauss also shows how fundamental oppositions are found across cultures, but are made real or concretized in ways that may be specific to that culture (e.g. westerners have the homesteaders vs Indians opposition)
    - over time, binary oppositions come to seem natural/obvious to us, and it takes a new approach to remind us that the meanings attaching to them are arbitrary
5. What is the argument of David Lodge regarding story and discourse?
    - identifies a second project concerned with the "poetics of fiction"
    - in this project, the focus is on understanding the role of the narrator and the relationship between the vents of the story and how they are recounted
6. What are Gerard Genette's three (3) aspects of narrative?
    - three aspects of narrative where the relations between story and discourse are especially significant, particularly with regards to time
    - Order
        - order of the discourse
        - and how this may depart from the chronological order of the story
        - how events are ordered in a narrative (may be significant in terms of the importance we assign to them and how we connect those events together, so that if events appear out of chronological sequence we tend to search for reasons why)
        - flashback - look behind to events in the past
        - flashforward - look ahead to events in the future
    - Duration
        - duration of the events
        - there may be a close correspondence between the time events take in reality and the time devoted to narrating them
    - Frequency
        - how often the narrative tells us about an event that has taken place
        - "singulative" instance is most common
        - if we are told "repetitively" about the same event, this may suggest that it is particularly noteworthy
7. What is Poststructuralism and what is its impact on narrative theory?
    - has had a huge impact on literary theory in particular, but also suffers from some negativity for its often seemingly impenetrable terminology, and for the fact that many of its main exponents seem more interested in their own activity than in telling us anything interesting about the narratives or texts they are allegedly discussing
    - is concerned with how language shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world around us (much like structuralism), but it takes much further the idea that the relationship between language and our reality is arbitrary and full of contradictions and gaps
    - more openly concerned with ideology
    - shows how loaded and unstable binary oppositions are (unlike what classic structuralism tries to say: that is, the world is something that can be neatly arranged into sets of binary oppositions suggestive of an either/or logic)
    - has had a big influence on contemporary gender and queer theories, as well as on studies of cybercultures where the whole relationship between the self and the physical body has been problematized
8. How significant are the mentioned concepts from numbers 1-7 in the understanding and theorization of story, narrative and discourse?
    - influential in helping us to explore ways of meaning in a wide range of contemporary practices and discourses
    - allows us to analyze stories more deeply! in terms of how they connect with human culture, like how they break the binary...
    - and how they make use of different discourse to tell the same story
