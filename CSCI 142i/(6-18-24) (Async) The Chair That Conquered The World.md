# The Chair That Conquered The World (June 18, 2024)

Asynchronous session!

For today's Asynchronous class, watch this video on one of the most common and ubiquitous designed items in the world:

[How This Chair Conquered The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwApFGwMIMQ)

Just some things to think about:

1. What makes this chair well-designed or badly designed in the lens and context of Everyday Design by Don Norman? 
2. If you were the executive chair designer for a company who makes these chairs, how would you change/modify its design from other monoblocs? Do you think there are any room for improvements?
3. While answering #2, how did you empathize with the target users or market of these monobloc chairs? 

*Note:* Keep in mind that design does not stop visually, so changes such as materials used or production techniques also count

## Guide Questions

1. What makes this chair well-designed or badly designed in the lens and context of Everyday Design by Don Norman? 
    - design uses enough materials that makes it easily scalable while also being enough to be stable and secure
    - stackable?!
    - badly designed because it's bad for the environment (plastic)
    - visibility
        - you can see that you can sit on it!
        - not very obvious at first, but you can also stack the chair
    - feedback
        - idt this is applicable
    - affordance
        - you can sit on it (even rest your arms on the arm rests if there are any)
        - you can stack it (the holes provide this function)
        - you can put stuff on it (flat surface, durable enough)
    - mapping
        - idt this is applicable
    - constraints
        - not sure what to put here
2. If you were the executive chair designer for a company who makes these chairs, how would you change/modify its design from other monoblocs? Do you think there are any room for improvements?
    - probably make it more ergonomic whenever applicable
    - probably put some arm rests when possible
    - would be cool to put some sort of design, maybe a change in color
    - although those have already been done, i can't think of any world-changing features to add since it's good as it is (and if i did have any, it probably would go against the mass production thing it has going)
    - do u think there could be an alternative material that has the same, if not better, durability? and something that is cheaper and better for the environment?
