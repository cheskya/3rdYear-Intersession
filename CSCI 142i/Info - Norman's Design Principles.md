## Visibility

Users should know, just by looking at an interface, what their options are and how to access them. (It's best to include only the options that are needed.)

- "Can I see it?"
- design that makes the conceptual model apparent to users
- design that informs users of what actions can be performed
- a scroll bar on a website tells you that you can use it go to a certain location on a page

## Feedback

The user must receive feedback after every action they perform to let them know whether or not their action was successful.

- "What is it doing now?"
- information about a user’s actions
- two types
    - activation feedback
        - when the response to an action is sensorial
        - e.g. visual effect, sound effect
    - behavioral feedback
        - when the response indicates that the action had some effect within the system
        - e.g. message confirming that your action was successfully performed

## Affordance

Affordance is the link between how things look and how they’re used.

- "How do I use it?"
- attributes of an object that imply its use
- provides strong clues for possible usage
- e.g. you know how to hold a coffee mug from its form, a door that you pull has a pull handle

## Mapping

Mapping is the idea that, in a good design, the controls for something will closely resemble their effect.

- "Where am I and where can I go?"
- the correspondence between the physical layout of objects and their controls.
- natural mapping
    - taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards. Leads to immediate understanding.
- e.g. the layout of the light switches can tell you which light it opens (natural mapping), arrows on the left and right side of the screen tells you that you can go back and forward a page

## Constraints

Constraints restrict a particular form of user interaction with an interface.

- "Why can't I do that?"
- physical, semantic, cultural or logical limitations that govern the use of an object
- restricting the kind of actions that can take place
- e.g. someone can tell from a usb stick's appearance which port it should go to, and what ports it can't go to

## Consistency

People learn new things and manage better when they recognize patterns.

- "I think I've seen this before."
- follows design rules consistently
- those who share similar design have similar behavior
- use consistent design as leverage to make interfaces easier to navigate and understand
- e.g. a log out button that looks the same no matter what page it's on
