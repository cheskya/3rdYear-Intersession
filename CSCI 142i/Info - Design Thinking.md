## What is Design Thinking?

- comprehensive, customer-oriented innovation approach
- aims to generate and develop creative ideas
- aims to find novel solutions that are both user-friendly and effective
- human-centered
- first founded in design industry but now is spread across other industries

---

## Key Characteristics

- integrative approach
    - combines diverse ideas/methods to create solutions
- early customer orientation
    - consider customer needs and feedback from the beginning of design process
- empathy
    - understanding and sharing the perspectives of users
- prototypes
    - creating early, simplified versions of a product to test and refine ideas
- iteration loops
    - repeatedly revisiting and refining ideas based on feedback
- team-oriented
    - focus on collaboration and diverse perspectives in the design process
- analytical phase combined with synthetic phases
    - blending data-driven decision-making (analytical) with the generation of creative solutions (synthetic)

## Three Lenses of Design Thinking

- desirability
    - has to be something that meets people's needs and wants
- feasibility
    - has to be possible technologically, depends on stakeholders' resources
- viablility
    - has to be able to sustain its own production in the long term, produce profits

## Phases of Design Thinking

-  empathize
    - involves understanding the needs and perspectives of the people who will be using the product or service
    - design thinkers immerse themselves in the users' experiences to gain insight into their behaviors, motivations, and challenges
    - understand, observe, engage
        - understand people in the context of the design challenge
        - observe what people do and how they interact with the environment
        - engage with people

-  define
    - take the information gathered from the previous phase (empathize) and analyze it
    - define the problems that needs to be solved
    - create a (human-centered) problem statement
        - bring clarity and focus to the design space
        - make sense of the info that you gathered
        - craft a meaningful and actionable problem statement

-  ideate
    - think and brainstorm ideas and potential solutions for the problems defined in the previous phase (define)
    - welcome creative ideas and be as open as possible to any solution to promote innovation
    - brainstorming, mind mapping, sketching, design documentation, etc.

-  prototype
    - create tangible representations of the ideas made in the previous step (ideate)
    - develop surface-level or barebone prototypes to test concepts
        - paper prototypes, wireframes
    - take some feedback internally and make adjustments accordingly

-  test
    - test the final prototype with target users identified in the first step
    - observe the users' behaviors while they are interacting with the prototypes
        - screen recording, live testing
    - take feedback from the users, ask questions based on how they experience can be improved, what was good, and refine the prototype into a final product
