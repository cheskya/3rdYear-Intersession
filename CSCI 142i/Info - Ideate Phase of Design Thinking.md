Summary:


- Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas.
- There are various techniques for ideation, each offering a unique pathway to unlocking creativity and can be tailored to different types of problems and team dynamics.
- Not every technique will suit every project or individual. The key is to experiment with different methods and find what resonates with you and your team.

## Ideation

- A creative process where designers generate ideas for potentially solving a problem
    - Requires a clearly defined problem statement
    - e.g. “How might we design an app for an efficient enrollment process for a tutorial center?”
- Needs to happen in a facilitated, judgment-free environment
    - Be open-minded to any possibility

---

## Ideation Process Environment

- Gather as a group, get a skilled facilitator
- Gather your data from previous steps – empathy map, user persona, etc.
- The goal is lay down each others’ ideas and build on them
    - Link concepts, recognize patterns, flip “out-of-this-world” ideas into something actually possible

## Ideation Techniques

### Brainstorming

- Generating ideas to solve a problem with the team members
- Best Practice Rules for Effective Brainstorming (www.interaction-design.org)
    - Set a time limit
    - Start with a question, a plan or a goal – and stay focused on the topic
    - Defer judgement or criticism, including non-verbal
    - Encourage weird, wacky and wild ideas
    - Aim for quantity
    - Build on each others' ideas
    - Be visual
    - Write down everything (or record)

### Braindumping

Similar to [[#Brainstorming|brainstorming]], but done *individually*!!

### Brainwriting

Similar to [[#Brainstorming|brainstorming]], but everyone writes down and passes ideas for others to add to before discussing.

- Encourages participation especially from those who are quieter in a discussion setting
- e.g. Participants write down their ideas on a piece of paper or in a shared document before passing them on to the next person who adds their own ideas or elaborates on the existing ones.

### Mindmapping

- A graphical technique to represent ideas and concepts around a central subject.
- Allows for structuring information in a visual manner.

### SCAMPER

- Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse
- A checklist that prompts you to think about a product, service, or process from different perspectives by asking probing questions related to each of the SCAMPER verbs.

### Storyboarding

Developing a visual problem/design/solution-related story to illustrate a situation’s dynamics.

### Worst Possible Idea

- An ideation method where the team deliberately come up with the worst, most terrible solutions to a problem.
- An “inverted” brainstorming approach.
    - Helps relax, boosts confidence, and stimulates creativity, enabling them to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and gain insights that lead to great concepts.
