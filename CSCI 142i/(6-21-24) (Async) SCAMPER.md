Asynchronous session!

For today's Asynchronous class, I want to pin a spotlight on the **SCAMPER** ideation technique. 

In SCAMPER, you as a designer with your team, have to think of relevant questions that follow the different letters in the acronym: **S**ubstitute, **C**ombine, **A**dapt, **M**odify, **P**ut to another use, **E**liminate, and **R**everse. You don't have to have the answers for these questions in the moment; as long as you think that they are relevant to the overall design goal, you can add them.

I truly believe that this is one of the more effective methods of ideation as it forces you to think of scenarios/questions that you wouldn't even think of in the first place. 

For now, I want you to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/2asOjJjupTQ?si=gwdcHMoGQJTFxXlF), where you can see a facilitated session where a group of people participate in the SCAMPER technique.
