Everyday things shouldn't be hard to use.

## Don Norman

 - coined the term "user-centered" design in his book
 - one of the most influential people in the design world

>"Design for people the way they are, not for how you want them to be"

• Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the en-
vironment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.
• Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
• Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and
how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they
fail to function.

## Design Principles

- Affordances
    - "How do I use it?"
    - the relationship between a physical object (its properties) and a person (their capabilities) that determine how the object can possibly be used
    - attributes of an object that imply its use
    - provides strong clues for possible usage
    - they exist even if they are not visible
    - e.g. a door with a pull handle, a chair that allows a space for one person to sit on

- Constraints
    - "Why can't I do that?"
    - physical, semantic, cultural or logical limitations that govern the use of an object
    - restricting the kind of actions that can take place
    - e.g. someone can tell which port a usb stick must go to

- Consistency
    - "I think I've seen this before."
    - follows design rules consistently
    - those who share similar design have similar behavior
    - use consistent design as leverage to make interfaces easier to navigate and understand
    - e.g. a log out button that looks the same no matter what page it's on

- Mappings
    - "Where am I and where can I go?"
    - the correspondence between the physical layout of objects and their controls.
    - **Natural mapping** - taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards. Leads to immediate understanding.
    - e.g. the layout of the light switches can tell you which light it opens (natural mapping), arrows on the left and right side of the screen tells you that you can go back and forward a page

- Visibility
    - "Can I see it?"
    - design that makes the conceptual model apparent to users
    - design that informs users of what actions can be performed
    - e.g. a scroll bar on a website tells you that you can use it go to a certain location on a page

- Feedback
    - "What is it doing now?"
    - information about a user’s actions
    - two types
        - activation feedback
        - behavioral feedback
    - e.g. a button's change in animation tells you that you've clicked it

### Affordances

- "How do I use it?"
- attributes of an object that imply its use
- provides strong clues for possible usage

If I'm going to use a product, I need to not think too much about it. I need to be able to know what to do with the product immediately given its form.

### Constraints

- "Why can't I do that?"
- physical, semantic, cultural or logical limitations that govern the use of an object
- restricting the kind of actions that can take place

### Consistency

- "I think I've seen this before."
- follows design rules consistently
- those who share similar designs have similar behaviors
- use consistent designs as leverage to make interfaces easier to navigate and understand

### Mappings

- "Where am I and where can I go?"
- the correspondence between the physical layout of objects and their controls
- natural mapping - taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards - leads to immediate understanding

The controls of something I use should map correctly to what they control. I need to know what the controls will do and what they'll control just by looking at them.

### Visibility

- "Can I see it?"
- design that makes the conceptual model apparent to users
- design that informs users of what actions can be performed

Similar to affordances, except this one is more of what can you see and not see, and what this means for you. Are there too many items on the shop? Does the appearance of this button being greyed out mean that you can't use it?

### Feedback

- "What is it doing now?"
- information about a user's actions
- what has been done? what has been completed?
- two types - activation and behavioral feedback

## Designer's Responsibility

- sometimes, the user's inability to operate things is not their fault, but the fault of the one who designed it
- mindset change!!!

Design is about compromise!
