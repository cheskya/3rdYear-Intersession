## Problem Statement

In this step, you must define the problem statement!

Must be **user-centric**, not business-centric!

- User-Centric
    - focuses on the needs and goals of the users
    - e.g. “Busy adults need an easy way to discover and enjoy entertainment that fits into their busy schedules so that they can relax and unwind.”
- Business-Centric
    - focuses on the business’ objectives
    - e.g. “We need to increase the number of subscribers to our online streaming service by 20% to meet quarterly revenue targets.”

---

## User Personas

- Humanize **“who”** you are designing for
- Using the data that was collected and analyzed from the previous step, you now construct a “snapshot” of your target users
- Fictional character – not a real person, but a representation of all the “types” of persons you are designing for
    - You can make multiple personas if you think it's not possible to represent every type of user in one persona

### Creating a User Persona

-  Start with your goal (i.e. focus on the task/s)
    - What is the purpose of your system/product?
    - What problem is your product trying to solve?
    - Surface level understanding of how your product could solve the problem
        - No need to know everything from the start
        - You improve the product as you go deeper in the process
    - You basically need all of this in order to give a story to your persona

-  Describe your user (based on [[Info - Define Phase of Design Thinking|“Define” step]])
    - Think of the basics:
        - Age, gender, educational background, standard details
        - Hobbies, professional background, technical skills
    - Now think of the details:
        - Specific needs, tendencies, behaviors that are relevant to the problem
        - Other environmental factors that may contribute to user experience

-  User motivation
    - What are their needs? (in relation to the problem)
    - What are they trying to achieve?
    - What are their capabilities? What are their limitations?

## Empathy Map

- A visualization that helps articulate what we know about our users
- One User or Multiple Users
- Can be used in the empathize/define stages

### But why an Empathy Map?

- We want to create a shared understanding of user needs
- We need a quick reference and visual aid for decision-making
    - Gather round as a team and make decisions with an empathy map present

### Parts of an Empathy Map

#### Says

- Contains what the users “say”. 
- Verbatim or direct quotes.
- e.g.
    - “I want something fast”.
    - “I don’t understand what this map shows.”
    - “I am loyal to Product X because of their customer service.”

#### Thinks

- Tries to capture what the users “think” during an experience.
- Pay attention to what they think but do not speak out.
- What occupies their thoughts? What matters to them?
- e.g.
    - “This is annoying.”
    - “This looks great but what can I do now”?

#### Does

- Actions taken by the user.
- Physical interactions
- e.g.
    - “Taps the app’s icon multiple times.”
    - “Looks for similar products before adding to cart.”

#### Feels

- User’s emotional state.
- Could be in the format: {adjective}: {brief context}
- What worries the user?
- What gets them excited?
- e.g.
    - Impatient: images and videos load too slowly
    - Confused: too many links and buttons
    - Worried: they might be losing data
