how to yeah

1. start with your goal
    - purpose of system/product
    - problem that your product is trying to solve
    - surface level understanding of how your product could solve the problem
        - no need to know everything from the start
        - improve the project as you go
    - you need all of this to humanize your persona


2. describe their user
    - think of the basics
        - age, gender, etc
        - hobbies, professional bg, etc

        - specific needs, tendencies, behaviors relevant to the problem
    - other environmental factors that may contribute to user experience
