## What is Empathize?

- the first stage of the design thinking process
- conduct research to get personal grasps of the users' needs
- requires setting aside assumptions to obtain insights into the users' world by observing and consulting with users
- understanding users' experiences, motivations, and problems

---

## Gathering information from the user

- direct
    - interview
    - observations
    - surveys
- indirect
    - online and offline studies
    - news and journals
    - social network
    - sentiment

## Specific methods to empathize with users

- desk research
    - "secondary research", "literature review"
    - gathering prior research findings that are related
        - RRL, recommendations
    - allows for understanding the context of the project by looking into what other people have done and/or have found out already

- contextual interviews / inquiry
    - watch and listen how the users work
    - has to be done in the user's usual environment
    - you may ask the users questions while they are working
    - allows you to observe them closely
    - similar to documentary style
    - what you may get
        - yes
    - how to conduct
        - yeah

- focus group discussions
    - a moderated discussion typically involving 5-10 participants from your target users
    - users tell you about their experiences and expectations
    - con: you cannot directly observe or verify things being shared to you
    - how to conduct
        - decide topics you wish to cover
        - this provides structure and allows you to save time
        - pre-test questions may be helpful
        - allows you to start with simple, direct to the point questions
        - develop open-ended questions
        - gives participants the opportunity to talk and share
        - a script may be helpful in directing the flow of the conversation
        - record the session (but participants must agree) or assign a note-taker

- individual interviews
    - talking with one user at a time
    - allows the interview to probe user beliefs, attitudes, desires, experiences
    - may be done face-to-face, by phone, video conference, instant messaging
    - guidelines for doings FGDs also apply to individual interviews
    - probe to get more info
        - yes
    - problem to learn underlying motivations
        - yeah

- surveys
    - target audience completes a structured questionnaire
    - can be paper-based or online
    - try to keep surveys as brief as possible
    - lengthy questionnaires can be dragging
    - keep your goal in mind and let that guide how you design your questions
    - can be a mix of open-ended and closed questions
