## Paradigms of HCI

Three distinct conceptualizations:

- interaction as human-machine coupling
	- 1965 to 1980
	- start of fusion of engineering and human factors (in business and government)
	- goal of HCI is to make efficient use of very expansive machines

- interaction as information processing and communication
	- 1980s
	- computers getting more cheaper and more powerful
	- rise of personal computers
	- non programmers can now use computers!
	- goal of HCI is to figure out how information goes in, how it's processed, how it goes out, and how it can be communicated effectively (e.g. GUIs)

- interaction as phenomenologically situated
	- 2000s and onwards
	- grew out of the success of the GUIs
	- HCI becoming more involved in the social realm
	- focus on conceptual, qualitative and participatory design methods
	- other perspectives are incorporated into HCI
	- not just about information anymore, but also about describing, taking into account, analyzing, and generating

## HCI generations

- first gen
	- modeled on mainframe
	- keyboard, etc

- second gen
	- GUI
	- e.g. IWIMP

- third gen
	- immersive screens
	- always-on access
