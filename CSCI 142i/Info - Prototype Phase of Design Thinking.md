# Prototype Phase of Design Thinking

Resource/s:

- [[Info - Design Thinking]]
- Lecture 07

Summary:

- Prototyping is meant to quickly transform ideas into a tangible, scaled down version of a product, allowing for user testing and feedback to refine the design iteratively, enhancing its effectiveness and user experience.
- The choice between low-, medium, or high-fidelity prototyping hinges on balancing project goals, user feedback needs, resource constraints, product complexity, stakeholder communication, and the design's iterative stage to optimally support the development process.
- The overall goal of prototyping is to to give an idea of how your app should work and conveying that to the target users
    - As long as they get how it will function, and can imagine how they would use it in their actual daily life, it means you have a good prototype

## Prototyping

- Producing an early, inexpensive, and scaled down version of a product.
- Goal is to make the idea tangible
    - To reveal any problems
    - To test the practicability
    - To gain feedback from target users
- “Fail quickly and cheaply”
- Prototypes are often used for testing
    - Enables designers and developers to investigate user behavior with their proposed product
    - Results of which are then used to refine the prototype into a shippable product

## Prototype Levels

### Low-Fidelity

- Little to no details, just the key features
- Used VERY early in the design process
- To check layout of objects
- Supposed to be cheap, easy to do
- e.g.
    - Rough Sketches
    - Storyboards
    - Paper prototypes

## Medium-Fidelity

- More detailed
- Usually digital versions of low-fidelity prototypes
- May include simulations of basic functionality
- e.g.
    - Wireframes/Mockups
    - Slides
    - Wizard-of-Oz
        - someone or something else handles the backend...

### High Fidelity Prototype

- Closely resembles the final product
- Visuals don't have to include actual assets to be used
    - can have diff colors, fonts, text copies
- e.g.
    - Interactive Prototypes
    - Clickable apps/pages

## How to Build a Prototype

- Just start building
    - Bias towards action; make idea concrete as quickly as possible
- Don’t spend too much time
    - Speed is key
    - The longer the time spent on building, the higher the tendency for “emotional attachment” – can limit your objective judgement
- Remember what you’re testing for
    - What central issue are you testing for?
    - But be open to insights that can be learned from the process, and let that help you “design better”
- Build with the user in mind
    - Keep users in mind always
